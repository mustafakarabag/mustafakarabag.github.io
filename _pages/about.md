I am a Postdoctoral Fellow at The Oden Institute of The University of Texas at Austin. I am a member of the Center for Autonomy working with Prof. Ufuk Topcu. 

## Research Interests
My research aims to develop decision-making methods for autonomous systems operating in **information-scarce or adversarial environments**. I focus on controlling the **information flow** of autonomous systems to provide performance guarantees in challangening environments by using techniques from controls, optimization, and information theory. 

## Bio
I did my PhD in Electrical & Computer Engineering at the University of Texas at Austin advised by Prof. Ufuk Topcu. Prior to my PhD, I obtained a BSc degree in Electrical & Electronics Engineering and a minor degree in Economics from Bogazici University.
