I am a Postdoctoral Fellow at The Oden Institute of The University of Texas at Austin. I am a member of the Center for Autonomy working with Prof. Ufuk Topcu. 

## Research Interests
My research focuses on decision-making and learning in shared environments where autonomous systems and humans influence each other by sharing and acquiring information. My goal is to design autonomous systems that are (i) secure and private against adversaries by *concealing sensitive information*, (ii) resilient against uncertainties by *detaching from dispensable information* and, (iii) inferable for other agents and humans by *efficiently conveying information*. I establish theoretical analyses of these system properties via control theory, information theory, and estimation theory and develop decision-making, optimization, and learning algorithms. I validate theoretical developments through experiments and human-subject research studies.
## Bio
I did my PhD in Electrical & Computer Engineering at the University of Texas at Austin advised by Prof. Ufuk Topcu. Prior to my PhD, I obtained a BSc degree in Electrical & Electronics Engineering and a minor degree in Economics from Bogazici University.
